Also need to make a post about sublime text

For the VIM mode there is no initial "key repeat"... to fix this go to the [link](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html) and cntrl F "repeat" there you will find the code block below:

**NOTICE** I changed the `2` to a `3` because I use Sublime Text 3
```{bash}
defaults write com.sublimetext.3 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
```


Sublime Text 3 packages I like:

Gitgutter
Vintage mode for vim keys
